# Leaflet-Challenge

# Overview
This project aims to enhance the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) earthquake data visualization tools. The first part of the project, "Create the Earthquake Visualization," involves visualizing a selected earthquake dataset using Leaflet.

# Create the Earthquake Visualization
1. BasicMap
Your task is to visualize an earthquake dataset. Follow these steps:

- Get your dataset:

  - Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page.
  - Choose a dataset (e.g., "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days").
  - Obtain the JSON representation of the selected dataset.

# Import and visualize the data:

  - Use Leaflet to create a map plotting all earthquakes based on longitude and latitude.
  - Size markers based on earthquake magnitude and color them based on depth.
  - Higher magnitudes should result in larger markers, while greater depths should be represented by darker colors.
  - Include popups that provide additional information when a marker is clicked.

# Create a legend:

  - Design a legend to provide context for map data.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the USGS Earthquake Data Visualization project aims to enhance the United States Geological Survey's earthquake data representation, utilizing Leaflet and GeoJSON to create an interactive map that communicates seismic information effectively.
